# FlappyFlight
Flappy Flight game using Pygame library

This game is very similar to what you might find in codewithharry youtube channel, additional changes include:
1. Base image tuned and changed.
2. Blit gameover image when game ends
3. Difficulty increases as the game proceeds.
4. Mouse click support for starting the game as well as  bouncing the bird.

Game description:
                This is a simple way to create a flappy flight game using Pygame library in Python, it involeves blitting of images, changing coordinates of the images to make it look interactive and manipulating speed of change in coordinates to provide difficulty to the game.
